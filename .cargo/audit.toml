# cargo-audit configuration — RustSec advisory database scanning.
# https://rustsec.org/
#
# This file configures `cargo audit` for VBW's security requirements.
# Run locally: `cargo audit` or `make audit`
# CI runs this on every PR and daily via scheduled workflow.

[advisories]
# Treat unmaintained crates as denial — a security tool must not depend
# on abandoned code that will never receive vulnerability patches.
unmaintained = "deny"

# Treat yanked crate versions as denial — yanked versions are typically
# pulled due to security issues or critical bugs.
yanked = "deny"

# Show the inverse dependency tree for each advisory so the auditor can
# see the full chain from VBW to the affected crate.
informational_warnings = ["unsound", "notice"]

# No advisories are currently ignored. If a false positive arises, add
# the advisory ID here with an explicit justification.
ignore = []

[output]
# Display dependency tree alongside each advisory for traceability.
