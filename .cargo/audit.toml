# cargo-audit configuration — RustSec advisory database scanning.
# https://rustsec.org/
#
# This file configures `cargo audit` for VBW's security requirements.
# Run locally: `cargo audit` or `make audit`
# CI runs this on every PR and daily via scheduled workflow.
#
# Note: `unmaintained` and `yanked` policies are enforced by cargo-deny
# (see deny.toml), not by cargo-audit. This file only controls the
# cargo-audit-specific settings.

[advisories]
# No advisories are currently ignored. If a false positive arises, add
# the advisory ID here with an explicit justification.
